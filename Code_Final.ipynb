      "1. Spatial Targeting (NNH2, NNH3):\n",
      "   - Focus investment on the 4 identified 'Low-Low' cold-spot districts to address spatial inequality. These are areas with low cultural activity surrounded by similar neighbors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Infrastructure & Programming (NNH1, NNH5, NNH7):\n",
      "   - Boost 'Cultural Vitality' in districts scoring below 10 by developing diverse facilities and supporting artists (NNH8), as vitality is a key predictor of event frequency.\n",
      "   - Address income-based stratification (NNH7) by expanding free/subsidized 'high culture' in lower-income areas to improve cultural equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Accessibility and Connectivity (NNH10, NNH11):\n",
      "   - Use network accessibility maps to identify areas with poor transit to cultural hubs and improve connections, enhancing overall access for all citizens. This is particularly important for bridging the gap between residential areas and cultural centers.\n",
